# `utils` Folder in a FastAPI Project

The `utils` folder in a FastAPI project contains utility functions and helper modules that are not domain-specific but support the overall application. These utilities are intended to make the code more concise, reusable, and maintainable. By keeping general-purpose functions in a separate folder, you avoid code duplication and improve the structure of the project.

## Purpose of the `utils` Folder

The `utils` folder is designed to store reusable code that helps simplify common operations across different parts of the application. These operations might not fit neatly within the core business logic but are necessary for the functioning of the app.

### Main Responsibilities:

1. **Encapsulation of Helper Functions**
   - Provides small, reusable functions for common tasks like formatting, validation, or calculations.
   - Simplifies code in other parts of the project by centralizing commonly-used functionality.

2. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Keeps code organized by distinguishing general-purpose utilities from business-specific logic.
   - Helps keep the core parts of the application (such as routers and services) focused on their primary tasks.

3. **Reusability**
   - Functions in the `utils` folder are designed to be used across different modules in the application, promoting code reuse and reducing redundancy.

## Typical Contents of the `utils` Folder

The `utils` folder may include modules for:

- **Validation**
  - Functions for validating input data, such as checking if an email is valid or ensuring password strength.
  - Example: Email validation, phone number validation.

- **Formatting and Parsing**
  - Helper functions for formatting strings, parsing dates, or converting data types.
  - Example: Converting JSON to XML, formatting dates for display.

- **Common Calculations**
  - Reusable functions for frequently performed calculations, such as tax calculation, currency conversion, or unit conversions.
  - Example: Calculating the price after a discount.

- **Logging and Debugging**
  - Helper functions for logging or debugging, like logging application errors or debugging complex data structures.
  - Example: Custom logging configurations or error tracking.

- **File Handling**
  - Functions for reading, writing, or processing files.
  - Example: Handling CSV imports/exports, image processing.
