# Services Folder in a FastAPI Project

In a FastAPI project, the `services` folder plays a crucial role in maintaining clean and modular code by separating the business logic from the rest of the application. This organization ensures better maintainability, scalability, and readability of the codebase.

---

## Purpose of the `services` Folder

The `services` folder typically contains all the business logic and domain-specific functionality of the application. Its main responsibilities include:

1. **Encapsulation of Business Logic**
   - Handles the core logic that defines the behavior of the application.
   - Separates complex processing or operations from the API layer (`routers`).

2. **Reusability**
   - Contains reusable functions or classes that can be called by multiple parts of the application, such as controllers, routers, or background tasks.

3. **Interaction with Other Layers**
   - Acts as a bridge between the API endpoints (in `routers`) and the database or external services.
   - Coordinates data retrieval, transformation, and other computations before responding to the API call.

## Typical Contents of the `services` Folder

The `services` folder may include modules for:

- **Data Processing**
  - Business-specific logic for data validation, transformation, or computation.
  - Example: Calculating discounts, risk coefficients, or data anonymization.

- **External Service Integration**
  - Functions for communicating with third-party APIs, external systems, or microservices.
  - Example: Payment gateways, email notification systems.

- **Background Tasks**
  - Code for long-running processes executed asynchronously.
  - Example: Sending an email after user registration.
